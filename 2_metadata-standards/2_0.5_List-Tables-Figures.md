An asterisk (\*) denotes an optional field. Hierarchical levels are shown in bold font above each section.](#metadata-standards-appendix-a-table-a-1)

[**Appendix A - Table A2.** Overview of the structure of the RCSC et al's Remote Camera Metadata Template (2023) including both the data fields recommended by the Remote Camera Survey Guidelines: Guidelines for Western Canada (RCSC et al., 2023) and these metadata standards.](#metadata-standards-appendix-a-table-a-2)

(2016), Wildlife Insights Minimum Metadata Standards (Ahumada et al., 2019) and the B.C. Metadata Standards (RISC, 2019) and the linkages with and within the four CSVs included in these metadata standards ("Project CSV," "Sample Station/Camera Location CSV," "Deployment CSV," and the "Image/Sequence CSV").](#metadata-standards-figure-3)
