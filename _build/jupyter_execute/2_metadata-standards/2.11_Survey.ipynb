    "A [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) is a unique [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment) period (temporal extent) within a [project](#Heirch_Project). There may be multiple [surveys](#Hierarch_Survey) in a single [project](#Heirch_Project). However, if multiple [surveys](#Hierarch_Survey) are completed in the same [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area) and following the same [Survey Design](#SurveyDesign) and methods of data collection, the [project](#Heirch_Project) and [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) information may be the same. If a [project](#Heirch_Project) includes more than one type of [survey](#Hierarch_Survey), each should be included separately, with a unique [Survey ID](#ID_survey) and [survey](#Hierarch_Survey)-specific information.\n",

    "A \"[Tag](#tag)\" refers to when individuals or groups of individuals are categorized within images, regardless of whether the information applies to all of the individuals in the image. A single [tag](#tag) is generally applied to one or more individuals with the same combination of characteristics (e.g., Adult Males displaying the same [Behaviour](#Behaviour). Conversely, individuals that have different characteristics would be given different [tags](#tag). For example, if the [Event Type](#event-type) is \"[Tag](#tag),\" two individuals with an image that are of different [Sex Classes](#Tags_Sex_class) would be categorized separately. This could also occur for [Age Class](#Tags_Age_class), [Behaviour](#Behaviour), [Human Transport Mode/Activity](#human-transport-mode-activity), etc. Since multiple [tags](#tag) can occur for a single image, there may be multiple data rows for the same image (if the [Event Type](#event-type) is at the \"[Tag](#tag)\" level)."
