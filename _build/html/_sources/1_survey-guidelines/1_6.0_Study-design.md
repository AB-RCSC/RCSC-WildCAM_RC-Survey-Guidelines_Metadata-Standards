# 6.0 Study design

[Project](#Heirch_Project) or [survey](#Hierarch_Survey)-level aspects of design that camera users should consider (at a minimum) are:

-   [Study area](#Hierarch_Study_area) extent and method of delineation (e.g., watershed or minimum convex polygon)
-   Criteria for site selection (e.g., [random](#Sampledesign_random), [systematic](#SampleDesign_Systematic), or [targeted](#SampleDesign_Targeted) habitat types or features)
-   Camera arrangement (e.g., [random](#Sampledesign_random) vs. cameras '[clustered](#sampledesign_clustered)' into hierarchical groups with common characteristics)' into hierarchical groups with common characteristics)
-   [Camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) (e.g., 1 km spacing between cameras) km spacing between cameras)
-   Number (or [density](#density)) of cameras
-   [Survey](#Hierarch_Survey) effort and timing (i.e., the number of days the camera was active and functioning during the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) period; the "[camera days per camera location](#Camera_days_per_camera_location)", the [total number of camera days](#Total_number_of_camera_days), time of
    year, and [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) duration)

These decisions will depend on the study [objectives](#Survey_objectives) as well as resources available.

Decisions concerning study design are a critical component to any wildlife [project](#Heirch_Project). These decisions can be complex, and, in these cases, it is highly advisable to consult an expert for direction.

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-study-area)=
## 6.1 Study area

A [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area) is a unique area(s) within a [project](#Heirch_Project). There may be multiple [study areas](#Hierarch_Study_area) within a larger [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area). Aspects to consider when identifying the [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area) include the spatial extent
(and method of delineation), shape (Foster & Harmsen, 2011), and composition and configuration of features within it (including habitat types, land uses and disturbances).

Several factors influence the size (spatial extent) of the study area, including the [objectives](#Survey_objectives), ecosystem, the biology of the [Target Species](#Target_species)' (e.g., dispersal ability, habitat preferences, etc.) and/or [modelling approach.](#Mods_Modelling_approach)

For example, [density](#density) models using the [capture-recapture (CR)](#Mods_CR_CMR) modelling approach requires that the [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area) encompasses the entire area in which individuals can move during the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) and that each individual can be detected by a camera
(Karanth & Nichols, 1998). In this case, the animal's home range size could be used (e.g., 4 times the home range size [Maffei & Noss, 2008]) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017) in combination with a finite number of cameras available (e.g., 20 cameras are available; ideally, they should be
[paired](#Sampledesign_paired) and there should be \>4 cameras in each home range [Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017]) to define the [project](#Heirch_Project)'s spatial extent.

Methods to delineate the appropriate spatial extent include, for example, minimum convex polygons (i.e., a polygon surrounding the locations of previous detections) or [kernel density estimators](#Kernel_density_estimator) (e.g., via the probability of "utilization" [Jennrich & Turner, 1969]).
Geographic Information Systems (GIS, e.g., ESRI software) or programming language (e.g., R) contain useful tools for these delineation methods.

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-site-selection-and-camera-arrangement)=
## 6.2 Site selection and camera arrangement

Remote [camera locations](#Heirch_Camera_location) (or [sample stations](#Heirch_Sample_station)) and their spatial arrangement are integral components of any study design; these choices will affect the user's ability to draw inference(s) about the species or question of interest. There are many
species-specific characteristics (e.g., body size, behaviour, rarity, etc.) and environmental factors (e.g., vegetation cover, snow depth) that influence the [detection probability](#Detection_probability) and probability of occurrence of a species, as well as the size of the area that should be
surveyed (e.g., Becker et al., 2022; Hofmeester et al., 2019; Iknayan et al., 2014; Steenweg et al., 2019). When there are multiple [Target Species](#Target_species), a mix of study designs may be valuable (Iannarilli et al., 2021; van Wilgenburg et al., 2020).

The [objectives](#Survey_objectives) of the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) will determine the most appropriate study design ([Appendix A - Table A2](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-2)). There are five commonly used study designs in camera studies: [simple random](#Sampledesign_random), [systematic
random](#SampleDesign_Systematic_Random) (grid), [stratified random](#SampleDesign_Stratified_Random), [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) (including [paired design](#Sampledesign_paired)) and [targeted](#SampleDesign_Targeted) (or opportunistic) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer 2017). A [convenience
sampling](#sampledesign_convenience) study design is also used when it is impractical to use another design. Sampling design can occur hierarchically, where one approach is used at a larger scale (i.e., to select grids to place cameras within), and another approach is used at a smaller scale (i.e.,
to select the location within each grid to place the camera). Refer to the following literature for additional recommendations on study design: Burton et al., 2015; Cusack et al., 2015; Fisher & Burton, 2012; Kolowski and Forrester, 2017; Meek et al., 2014b; O'Connell et al., 2011b; Rovero et al.,
2013; Steenweg et al., 2015; Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017 and WildCAM's ["sampling design & effort" section of their resource library](https://wildcams.ca/library/camera-trapping-papers-directory/).

Note that we refer to different configurations of cameras more generally as study design and sampling design; however, the term "[**Survey Design**](#SurveyDesign)" is how the study design is referred to when it applies to an individual [survey](#Hierarch_Survey). There may be multiple [Survey
Designs](#SurveyDesign) for [surveys](#Hierarch_Survey) within a [project](#Heirch_Project); the [Survey Design](#SurveyDesign) should be reported separately for each [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) within a [project](#Heirch_Project). When the [Survey Design](#SurveyDesign) is heirarchical, "Heirarchical
(multiple)\*" should be reported and additional details should be included in the [Survey Design Description](#SurveyDesignDescription). Refer to the AB Metadata Standards (RCSC, 2023) for more information.

**Figure 3.** Examples of sampling designs: (a) simple [random](#Sampledesign_random), (b) [systematic](#SampleDesign_Systematic_Random), (c) [stratified](#SampleDesign_Stratified) (each grid cell is a stratum), and (d) [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) (adapted from Schweiger, 2020).


(#TOC-survey-guidelines-Random)=
### 6.2.1 Simple random design

**Simple random** design ([Figure 3a](#survey-guidelines-figure-3)) -- cameras occur at randomized locations across the [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area), sometimes with a predetermined minimum distance between stations. A [random design](#Sampledesign_random) may help reduce biases that arise from
selecting [camera locations](#Heirch_Camera_location) deliberately. It may also allow the user to make inferences to areas that were not surveyed when employing use-based approaches (e.g. [occupancy models](#Mods_Occupancy_model) [MacKenzie et al., 2002]; [intensity of use](#Intensity_of_use)
methods [Keim et al., 2019]). Some [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach) (e.g., [random encounter and staying time [REST]](#Mods_REST); Nakashima et al., 2018) and [random encounter models [REM](#Mods_REM); Rowcliffe et al., 2008, 2013]) require a simple [random
design](#Sampledesign_random) ([Appendix A - Table A2](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-2)).

A disadvantage of using a simple random design is the tendency to see fewer animals (i.e., is less efficient) when animals are [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) or exhibit habitat preferences, and possibility of missing rare habitat types. The proportion of different strata (e.g., habitat types)
sampled should be the same as (or close to) the true proportion in the [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area). For example, if the [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area) consists of 25% young deciduous forest, then 25% of randomly selected sites should be within young deciduous forest, on average.

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-Systematic)=
### 6.2.2 Systematic design

**Systematic** design ([Figure 3b](#survey-guidelines-figure-3)) -- [camera locations](#Heirch_Camera_location) occur within a regular pattern (e.g., a grid pattern) across the [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area).

**Systematic random** -- [camera locations](#Heirch_Camera_location) are selected using a two-stage approach. Firstly, girds are selected systematically (to occur within a regular pattern) across the [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area). The location of the camera within each grid is then selected
randomly. This method is similar to the simple [random design](#Sampledesign_random). The same advantages apply in terms of unbiased landscape representation, and the same [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach) can be used. The disadvantage of using a [systematic
random](#SampleDesign_Systematic_Random) (or [simple random](#Sampledesign_random) design) is that rare habitat types may be missed.

**Systematic non-random** design -- sets of [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) cameras can be deployed within a [systematic non-random](#SampleDesign_Systematic) approach (i.e,. "systematic clustered" or "systematic paired") to assess the effects of disturbance along a gradient, over
time, at multiple scales and/or with control (i.e., reference) [sample stations](#Heirch_Sample_station). **Hierarchical Before-After Dose-Response (BADR)** is one such method that requires cameras to be placed within a systematic non-random approach, where [camera
locations](#Heirch_Camera_location) occur along transects or in [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) arrays ([sample stations](#Heirch_Sample_station)), selected using a nested spatial hierarchy of sampling to control for variability in land-use type and large-scale patterns (Bayne et al., 2022).
The [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area) is divided into land-use regions based on land-use type, then into landscape units, which are assessed for environmental variability to determine where [sample stations](#Heirch_Sample_station) should be placed (Bayne et al., 2022). The "Before-After" component
of BADR incorporates the phase of stressors (i.e., proposed, or current development) (Bayne et al., 2022). The "Dose-Response" component of BADR controls for the variable distribution of activity (and the potential impacts) by incorporating control (or reference) [sample
stations](#Heirch_Sample_station) and/or by placing cameras in [sample stations](#Heirch_Sample_station) along a gradient of disturbance (Bayne et al., 2022).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-Stratified)=
### 6.2.3 Stratified design

**Stratified random** design ([Figure 3c](#survey-guidelines-figure-3)) -- the area of interest is divided into smaller strata (e.g., habitat type, disturbance levels), and then a proportional random sample of sites is selected within each stratum (e.g., 15%, 35% and 50% of sites within high, medium and low disturbance strata). This design can help ensure that the sample adequately reflects the major or uncommon strata of interest and may be an efficient approach when users are limited by accessibility constraints (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). This design can also be used to increase precision if animal densities are known to be highly variable (Junker et al., 2021) or when a species is expected to occur in certain habitat types more often (Gillespie et al., 2015). For example, studies that wish to assess species richness, or [occupancy](#Occupancy) rates for a particular species, amongst
strata would use a [stratified random](#SampleDesign_Stratified_Random) design.

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-Clustered-Paired)=
### 6.2.4 Clustered / Paired designs

**Clustered** design ([Figure 3d](#survey-guidelines-figure-3)) -- multiple cameras are deployed at a [sample station](#Heirch_Sample_station). The distance between cameras ([camera spacing](#Camera_spacing)) will be influenced by the chosen sampling design, the [Survey Objectives](#Survey_objectives), the
[Target Species](#Target_species) and data analysis. A [clustered design](#sampledesign_clustered) can be used within a [systematic](#SampleDesign_Systematic) or [stratified](#SampleDesign_Stratified) approach (i.e., systematic clustered design or as a clustered random design) (Wearn &
Glover-Kapfer, 2017). A [clustered design](#sampledesign_clustered) is common when users are interested in individual identification, such as [density](#density) estimation from [marked](#TypeID_marked) or [partially marked populations](#TypeID_Partially_marked) (e.g., [spatially explicit
capture-recapture [SECR](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cjsteven_ualberta_ca/Documents/%20h#Mods_SCR_SECR); Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008] or [spatial mark-resight [SMR](#Mods_SMR); Doran-Myers, 2018]). A [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) design can
also be used in an [occupancy framework](#Mods_Occupancy_model) (O'Connell & Bailey, 2011; Pacifici, 2015) when interested in measures of species richness (O'Brien et al., 2011).

A [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) design can be a cost-efficient approach to increase the number of replicates at each site (especially when accessibility is limiting; Gálvez et al., 2016) and to reduce measurement error and improve precision (Clarke et al., 2019). However, [spatial
autocorrelation](#Spatial_autocorrelation) may occur with this design (Moqanaki et al., 2021), depending on the [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) (see [section 6.2.7](#Psuedoreplication)).

**Paired design** -- a form of "[clustered design](#sampledesign_clustered)" when two cameras are deployed in close proximity to one another at a [sample station](#Heirch_Sample_station) ("paired cameras"). A [paired design](#Sampledesign_paired) may also refer to when one or more cameras are
deployed at two separate locations that are in close proximity or with some characteristics in common ("paired sites", e.g. when interested in comparing "control" versus "experimental" sites, or on- versus off-trails). For some [objectives](#Survey_objectives), pairs of cameras might be considered
subsamples within another sampling design (e.g., [simple random](#Sampledesign_random), [stratified random](#SampleDesign_Systematic_Random), [systematic](#SampleDesign_Systematic)).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-Targeted)=
### 6.2.5 Targeted design

**Targeted** design -- cameras are placed in areas that are known or suspected to have higher activity levels (e.g., game trails, mineral licks, etc.). This design is useful when monitoring rare or cryptic species that are unlikely to be detected with other designs. This design is commonly used when
estimating densities of [marked populations](#TypeID_marked) (e.g., [spatially explicit capture-recapture [SECR](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cjsteven_ualberta_ca/Documents/%20h#Mods_SCR_SECR); Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008]) or behaviour studies. It is,
however, important to understand that [targeted](#SampleDesign_Targeted) sampling may impede one's ability to make inferences beyond the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) area. For some [objectives](#Survey_objectives), [targeted](#SampleDesign_Targeted) sampling may be used within another sampling design (e.g., a
[stratified random](#SampleDesign_Stratified_Random) sample of game trails and seismic lines; Keim et al. 2021).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-Convenience)=
### 6.2.6 Convenience design

**Convenience** sampling design -- [camera locations](#Heirch_Camera_location) or [sample stations](#Heirch_Sample_station) are chosen based on logistic considerations (e.g., remoteness, access constraints, costs). When cost is a key consideration, other more rigorous sampling designs (e.g.,
stratified; van Wilgenburg et al., 2020) that can incorporate cost should be considered first. One should be cautious when generalizing or drawing conclusions from data collected using [convenience sampling](#sampledesign_convenience), given that estimates can be biased if the sample poorly
represents the population of interest. The [convenience sampling](#sampledesign_convenience) design can be used where the goal is to [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) a specific location(s) without the intent to generalize to un-surveyed areas (Gillespie et al., 2015; e.g., Kusi et al., 2020) or to
[survey](#Hierarch_Survey) an area following a report of the occurrence of a rare species. Both [randomized](#Sampledesign_random) (e.g., Found & Patterson, 2020) or [targeted](#SampleDesign_Targeted) approaches can be used within a [convenience sampling](#sampledesign_convenience) approach, although the
user should still be cautious about extrapolating inferences to areas (or habitat types in an [occupancy framework](#Mods_Occupancy_model) [MacKenzie et al., 2002]) that were not sampled and, therefore, not represented in the data (Gillespie et al., 2015).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-Psuedoreplication)=
### 6.2.7 Psuedoreplication

[**Spatial autocorrelation**](#Spatial_autocorrelation) (i.e., the tendency for sites that are close together to be more similar) may occur when multiple cameras are placed nearby (such as in *clustered, paired or array sampling*). [Spatial autocorrelation](#Spatial_autocorrelation) is a form of
[pseudoreplication](#Psuedoreplication) (Hurlbert, 1984; when observations are not statistically independent but are treated as if they are) and can be problematic because it can artificifically inflate or diminish ecological effects. The degree to which this is a problem will depend on the [Target
Species](#Target_species) (i.e., how far they can travel may dictate the distance at which another camera is too near) and [modelling approach](#Mods_Modelling_approach). In these cases, users should consider an analytical framework that accommodates autocorrelation to avoid issues of spatial
[pseudoreplication](#Psuedoreplication) (Hurlbert, 1984) and false conclusions (Ramage et al., 2013) (e.g., using random effects [Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017] or spatial autoregressive models [Kelejian & Prucha, 1998]).

::: {note}
[Pseudoreplication](#Psuedoreplication) (Hurlbert, 1984) can also occur over time (e.g., if [camera locations](#Heirch_Camera_location) are sampled repeatedly to obtain detection rates as a repeated counts, or if the [inter-detection interval](#Inter_detection_interval) is too short for a sebsequent
detection to be truly independent of the first detection).
:::

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-camera-spacing)=
## 6.3 Camera spacing

The distance between cameras (the "[camera spacing](#Camera_spacing)", also referred to as"inter-trap distance") is an important consideration when designing a camera [survey](#Hierarch_Survey). This will be influenced by the chosen sampling design, the [Survey Objectives](#Survey_objectives), the [Target Species](#Target_species), [modelling approach](#Mods_Modelling_approach) and data analysis.

For example, if the [objective](#Survey_objectives) is to estimate grizzly bear [occupancy](#Occupancy) and cameras are placed close together, detections may not be statistically independent if the same individual is detected at neighbouring camera sites within a short time period. In contrast, if the objective was to estimate [occupancy](#Occupancy) for a different species such as marten, the [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) may be statistically independent in this case.

It is important that you understand how the [Survey Objectives](#Survey_objectives) influence sampling design and decisions about [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). When estimating [density](#density) from [marked](#TypeID_marked) populations using a [clustered
design](#sampledesign_clustered) and [SECR](#Mods_SCR_SECR) [modelling approach](#Mods_Modelling_approach) (Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008), for example, the spacing between clusters and cameras within a cluster are important considerations (Clarke et al., 2019). In this case, placing cameras in close proximity to one another can increase the [detection probability](#Detection_probability), and in turn, increase statistical power, shorten [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) lengths, and reduce costs (WildCAM Network, 2019). However, detections from nearby cameras may not be independent and could lead to issues with [pseudoreplication](#Psuedoreplication) (Hurlbert, 1984) and false conclusions (Ramage et al., 2013).

The spacing requirements of the different [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach) (dictated by the [objectives](#Survey_objectives)) vary and should be considered carefully. The recommendations for [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) for various [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach) are summarized below and in [Appendix A - Table A2](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-2).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-modelling-approach)=
### 6.3.1 Modelling approach

The spacing requirements of the different [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach) (dictated by the [objectives](#Survey_objectives)) vary and should be considered carefully. The recommendations for [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) for various [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach) are summarized below.

-   There are no guidelines for spacing requirements for [species inventory](#Mods_Inventory) [projects](#Heirch_Project).
-   For **species richness**, **species diversity**, and [relative abundance](#Mods_Relative_abundance), spacing of at least 1--2 kilometres apart should be adequate to ensure that cameras are spatially independent (Colyn et al., 2018; Rovero et al., 2013; Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). It is
    important when combining [relative abundance](#Mods_Relative_abundance) data from multiple [surveys](#Hierarch_Survey) to use the same [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing), as [relative abundance](#Mods_Relative_abundance) estimates can increase as [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) decreases (and
    vice-versa; Anile & Devillard, 2016)]. [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) decreases (and vice-versa; Anile & Devillard, 2016)].
-   For [occupancy models](#Mods_Occupancy_model) (MacKenzie et al., 2002), the [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) should be comparable to the size of the home range of the [Target Species](#Target_species) \<#Target_species\>(i.e., one home range diameter apart) to ensure that only one animal is
    recorded per sampling unit (Linden et al., 2017; Neilson et al., 2018; Rovero et al., 2013; Steenweg et al., 2018; Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). (i.e., one home range diameter apart) to ensure that only one animal is recorded per sampling unit (Linden et al., 2017; Neilson et al., 2018; Rovero
    et al., 2013; Steenweg et al., 2018; Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).
-   For [capture-recapture (CR) models](#Mods_CR_CMR) ([density](#density); Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998), [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) should be analogous to the home-range scale or smaller. With the advent of [spatially explicit capture-recapture
    [SECR](#Mods_SCR_SECR); Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008] models, [CR models](#Mods_CR_CMR) (Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) are seldom used and no longer recommended. (Karanth,
    1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) are seldom used and no longer recommended.
-   For [spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR](#Mods_SCR_SECR); Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008) models, the optimum [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) is 0.3 times the home range
    diameter of the [Target Species](#Target_species), with up to 0.8 times the home range diameter being acceptable (O'Brien & Kinnaird, 2011; Rovero et al., 2013; Soria-Díaz et al., 2010; Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).
    [SECR](#Mods_SCR_SECR) models (Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008) are, however, robust to increased [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) (Sollmann et al., 2012; Zimmermann, 2013). Sampling over
    a larger spatial extent may be more important in some cases than preserving recommended [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) (Sollmann et al., 2012; Zimmermann et al., 2013). (Sollmann et al., 2012; Zimmermann, 2013). Sampling over a larger spatial extent may be more important in some cases than
    preserving recommended [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) (Sollmann et al., 2012; Zimmermann et al., 2013).
-   For [random encounter models (REM](#Mods_REM); [density](#density); Rowcliffe et al., 2008), the [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) should be large enough to avoid sampling the same individual repeatedly (i.e., observations are independent; Rovero et al., 2013; Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).
    Cameras should be spaced farther apart than the home range diameter of the [Target Species](#Target_species) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).

Refer to [Appendix A - Table A2](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-2) for additional recommendations on [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing) for the different [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-avoidance-behaviour)=
### 6.3.2 Avoidance behaviour

Interactions between species can also influence the choice of [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing). For example, a study of interactions between Tasmanian devils and domestic cats found that cats avoided Tasmanian devils over short distances. Such avoidance behaviours can be problematic when a [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) targets the species showing these behaviours, or when the behaviours are not accounted for in the study design or data analyses (Fancourt, 2016).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-site-closure-assumption)=
### 6.3.3 Site closure assumption

Many [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach) (e.g. [occupancy models](#Mods_Occupancy_model) [MacKenzie et al., 2004]; [Appendix A - Table A1](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-1)) assume "site closure" (i.e., that there is no change in state (e.g. species presence/ absence, immigration/ emigration,
births/deaths) during the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) period (MacKenzie et al., 2004). For some approaches, violation of the site closure [assumption](#Mods_Modelling_assumption) can result in an underestimate of [detection probabilities](#Detection_probability) and, in turn, over-estimate [density](#density) (e.g., with spatial recapture models) or result in simply averaging detections over the sampling period (e.g., [REM](#Mods_REM) [Rowcliffe et al., 2008, 2013], [REST](#Mods_REST) [Nakashima et al., 2017] models). To meet the "site closure" [assumption](#Mods_Modelling_assumption), the study design might include spacing cameras far enough apart that the same individual is not detected at multiple sites (e.g., larger than the species' home range size). The [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) duration might also be short enough that the probability of [occupancy](#Occupancy) does not change (i.e., not confounded by other processes, e.g., by changes in the population since [occupancy](#Occupancy) is a function of abundance) (O'Connell & Bailey, 2011). Refer to [Appendix A - Table A2](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-2) for recommendations on how to deploy cameras to meet "site closure" [assumptions](#Mods_Modelling_assumption).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-survey-effort-and-timing)=
## 6.4 Survey effort and timing

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-survey-effort-number-of-cameras)=
### 6.4.1 Survey effort - Number of cameras

[Appendix A - Table A2](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-2) shows the recommended minimum of cameras according to the [Survey Objectives](#Survey_objectives) and [modelling approach](#Mods_Modelling_approach). The optimal number of cameras required will be influenced by factors such as landscape heterogeneity, [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) duration and spatial scale, species rarity and desired level of precision (Colyn et al., 2018; Rovero et al., 2013). For example, Kays et al. (2020) found that 25--35 cameras were needed for precise estimates of species richness, depending on the spatial scale of the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) and landscape diversity. The number of cameras required for precise estimates of [occupancy](#Occupancy) was highly sensitive to the occurrence rate of species, with \<20 cameras required for common species and \>150 cameras required for rare species (Kays et al., 2020). In general, deploying more cameras and/or for longer durations always results in more precise estimates; however, users can consider rotating cameras across multiple sites for shorter durations (if feasible). There are several useful references and applications available to help determine the optimal number of cameras for a [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) (e.g., Efford & Boulanger, 2019).

When the [objectives](#Survey_objectives) and [modelling approach](#Mods_Modelling_approach) warrant, placing multiple cameras at a site (either on the same attachment point or nearby) can significantly increase the [detection probability](#Detection_probability) of less common species (more than
increasing the number of [camera days per camera location](#Camera_days_per_camera_location); O'Connor et al., 2017; Pease & Holzmueller, 2016; Stokeld et al., 2016) or be useful for individual identification.

A second related consideration in terms of [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) effort is how long to [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) (i.e., the number of "[camera days per camera location](#Camera_days_per_camera_location)") at each [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location). Specifically, the number of [camera days per camera
location](#Camera_days_per_camera_location) is the number of days that each camera was active and functioning during the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey). It is important to consider how the [Survey Objectives](#Survey_objectives) and [assumption](#Mods_Modelling_assumption)s of the chosen [modelling
approach](#Mods_Modelling_approach) may influence this decision.

Wearn and Glover-Kapfer (2017) suggested that for estimates of [density](#density), species richness, [relative abundance](#Mods_Relative_abundance) and [occupancy](#Occupancy), each camera should remain active for a minimum of 30 camera days. Steenweg et al. (2019) found that increasing the number of [camera days per camera location](#Camera_days_per_camera_location) improved the likelihood of detecting a change in [occupancy](#Occupancy), but only when the [cumulative detection probability](#cumulative_det_probability) (i.e., "the probability of detecting a species at least once during the entire [survey](#Hierarch_Survey)" [Steenweg et al., 2019]) was below a certain threshold (\<0.80). In other words, if cameras were deployed long enough to reach a [cumulative detection probability](#cumulative_det_probability) \>0.8 for the [Target Species](#Target_species) and [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) period, there was no benefit to surveying longer at one [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location) (Long et al., 2008; Steenweg et al., 2019) (see also [section 6.4.4](#TOC-survey-guidelines-species-rarity)).

For measures of species richness or diversity, it is presumed that a camera is active long enough to detect rare species that may occur at a specific location (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). If this is not the case, the results will indicate that the species was not present when it was (i.e., a
"false negative"). False negatives may also be problematic for other measures, such as [**relative abundance indices**](#Mods_Relative_abundance) (count data, with or without [zero-inflation](#mods_Zero_inflation) and/or [overdispersion](#Mods_Overdispersion)), even if the model type used can account for [imperfect detection](#Imperfect_detection) explicitly (e.g., combined occurrence/[relative abundance](#Mods_Relative_abundance); [N-mixture models](#Mods_N_mixture_model)).

Variability in sampling effort amongst cameras can be accounted for in many approaches (e.g., for count data, an "offset" can be used to convert the count to a rate per unit time while still abiding by the [assumption](#Mods_Modelling_assumption)s of count-distributed data [Gallo et al., 2022; Moll
et al., 2020]).

### 6.4.3 Survey effort - Total number of camera days

The [**total number of camera days**](#Total_number_of_camera_days) is the number of days that all cameras were active during the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey). [Appendix A - Table A2](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-2) provides recommendations on the minimum number of [total number of camera
days](#Total_number_of_camera_days).

An adequate sample size (in terms of the [total number of camera days](#Total_number_of_camera_days)) in multiple seasons is often required to capture seasonal variation in [occupancy](#Occupancy) or [detection rates](#Detection_rate). As a general guideline, Kays et al. (2020) recommended that
cameras run for 3-5 weeks across 40-60 sites per array and that small-scale variation in [detection probability](#Detection_probability) across sites (e.g., microhabitats) should be accounted for in subsequent statistical analyses.

Becker et al. (2022) evaluated how the [effective detection distance](#Effective_detection_distance) of cameras changed across species, habitat type and season. [Effective detection distance](#Effective_detection_distance) refers to the distance from a camera that would give the same number of detections if all animals up to that distance are perfectly detected and no animals that are farther away are detected; Buckland [1987], Becker et al. [2022]). In general, deploying more cameras and/or for longer durations always resulted in more precise estimates (Becker et al., 2022).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-species-rarity)=
### 6.4.4 Species rarity

Species' rarity can influence the ideal number of cameras and [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) length (Chatterjee et al., 2021) (see also [section 6.4.2](#TOC-survey-guidelines-survey-effort-camera-days-per-camera-location)). Low [detection probability](#Detection_probability) of rare or cryptic species can result in imprecise estimates if there are too few cameras or if cameras are not deployed for long enough (e.g., Steenweg et al. 2019). Chatterjee et al. (2021) suggested that for [occupancy models](#Mods_Occupancy_model) (MacKenzie et al., 2002) of common species, to survey a minimum of 50 sites for 15--20 days. For rare, elusive species, they recommended surveying 100 sites at minimum for 20--30 days (Chatterjee et al., 2021).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-number-of-camera-vs-camera-days-per-camera-location)=
### 6.4.5 Number of cameras vs. Camera days per camera location

If a user must choose between more cameras *vs.* fewer cameras with longer [surveys](#Hierarch_Survey), Chatterjee et al. (2021) suggested that for rare species, the optimal precision can be obtained by increasing the number of sites, whereas for common species, increasing the number of samples is more
effective. For measuring species richness, Si et al. (2014) found that rotating cameras to new sites was more efficient than leaving cameras at fewer sites for longer periods. O'Connor et al. (2017) also recommended utilizing more cameras *vs*. increasing study length to increase [detection probabilities](#Detection_probability). [Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR];(#Mods_SCR_SECR) Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008) models were the only models shown to be quite robust to small camera quantities, with just spacing cameras farther out being a more efficient way to increase precision (Sollmann et al., 2012).

In general, regardless of species and [objective](#Survey_objectives), increasing the number of [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) locations or the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) length improved precision (Chatterjee et al., 2021). Tools such as the [secrdesignapp](https://www.stats.otago.ac.nz/secrdesignapp/) can help camera users determine the optimal study design for improved precision (Efford & Boulanger, 2019).

(#TOC-survey-guidelines-survey-timing)=
### 6.4.6 Survey timing

The season of the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) should be considered when designing a remote camera study. [Detection probability](#Detection_probability) of species may vary seasonally due to changes in species movement rates, behaviour, use patterns, and vegetation growth. Certain species may not be
detectable during certain times of year (e.g., hibernation or migration; Kays et al., 2020). Other species have seasonal activity patterns (e.g., birthing period, wet/dry seasons) that influence [detection probability](#Detection_probability) and, thus, the data collected.
