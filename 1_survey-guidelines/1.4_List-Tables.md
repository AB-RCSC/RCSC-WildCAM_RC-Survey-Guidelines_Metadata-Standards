# List of Tables

**Table 1.** A subset of software platforms and tools for data storage, image processing, and data analysis / analytics. Refer to <https://wildcams.ca/library/camera-trap-software-and-data-management/> for a comprehensive comparison of commonly used software platforms

**Appendix A - Table A1.** Summary of the assumptions and pros/cons of the different modelling approaches (adapted from Wearn & Glover-Kapfer [2017] and Clarke et al. [2022])

**Appendix A - Table A2.** Summary of appropriate study design, camera spacing, and survey effort (adapted from Wearn & Glover-Kapfer [2017] with additional references included) for various modelling approaches. Note -- these are guidelines only, using best available information. There is uncertainty associated with each of the different approaches. To address this, the table contains 'minimum', 'ideal' and 'often' used values, as well as qualifiers

**Appendix A - Table A3.** Example of camera settings and recommended camera settings options (Reconyx Camera Models)

**Appendix A - Table A4.** Recommended equipment for field deployments (checklist)

**Appendix A - Table A5.** Steps to deploy a remote camera

**Appendix A -** Camera Deployment Field Datasheet

**Appendix A -** Test Image Sheet

**Appendix A -** Camera Service/Retrieval Field Datasheet
