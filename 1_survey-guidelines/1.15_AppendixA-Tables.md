**Table A1**. Summary of the [assumptions](#Mods_Modelling_assumption) and pros/cons of the different [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach) (adapted from Wearn & Glover-Kapfer [2017] and Clarke et al. [2022]).\

\
\
**Table A2.** Summary of appropriate [study design](#survey), [camera spacing](#Camera_spacing), and [survey](#survey) effort (adapted from Wearn & Glover-Kapfer [2017] with additional references included) for various [modelling approaches](#Mods_Modelling_approach). Note -- these are guidelines only, using best available information. There is uncertainty associated with each of the different approaches. To address this, the table contains 'minimum', 'ideal' and 'often' used values, as well as qualifiers.
