Note -- these are guidelines only, using best available information. There is uncertainty associated with each of the different approaches. To address this, the table contains 'minimum', 'ideal' and 'often' used values, as well as qualifiers](#survey-guidelines-appendix-a-table-a-2)\n",

Important specifications include the camera's detection zone (here termed \"trigger area\"), Field of View (FOV; \"viewable area'), and\"registration area\" (the area in which an animal entering has at least some probability of being captured on the image) (Moeller et al., 2023)](#survey-guidelines-figure-5)\n",

The models in the yellow rectangle are for marked and partially-marked populations; the remaining models are for unmarked populations. Note, the models in this decision tree are not necessarily ordered from strongest to weakest, but rather are organized by key features.\" (Clarke et al., 2022)](#TOC-survey-guidelines-appendix-b)"
