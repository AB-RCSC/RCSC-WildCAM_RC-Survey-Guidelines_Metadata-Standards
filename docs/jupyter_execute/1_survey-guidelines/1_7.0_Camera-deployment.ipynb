    "The **size of the SD card** (i.e., storage capacity) should be considered in relation to the expected duration of [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment), the deployment area, and the level of activity expected to occur in front of the camera.

    "\n",
    "[Time-lapse images](#Timelapse_images) are images taken at regular intervals (e.g., hourly or daily, on the hour), regardless of whether an animal is present or not.

    "[Scent lure](#BaitLure_Scent_lure) is typically applied to objects in the [detection zone](#Detection_zone) (e.g., trees or rocks), whereas food [lure](#BaitLure_Lure) is generally hung up or placed behind wire mesh to limit tampering by animals.

    "Some options are costly and require frequent reapplication during the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment).

    "Since species may respond to [lure](#BaitLure_Lure) types and scents differently, the type of [lure](#BaitLure_Lure) chosen (if any) should be based on the biology of the [Target Species](#Target_species) but also on the [Survey Objectives](#Survey_objectives) and the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) environment. For example, liquid products may be less suitable in areas where precipitation is high.
