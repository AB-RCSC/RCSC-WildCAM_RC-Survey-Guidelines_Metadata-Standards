    "\n",
    "Data management is a critical component of any [project](#Heirch_Project). Below are recommendations on file naming conventions and file structure to help manage remote camera data. Refer to the [Remote Camera Survey Guidelines (RCSC et al., 2023)](#remote-cam-survey-guidelines) for additional information topics related to data management, including software platforms and tools to help camera users enter metadata as well as store, process and analyze image data.\n",

    "## 10.1 Naming conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended that users develop a set of naming conventions prior to entering data. Using naming conventions will minimize the risk of having images from different [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment)s, [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area)s, or [survey](#Hierarch_Survey)s with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming conventions are especially important for the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Project ID](#ID_Project)\n",
    "-   [Study Area ID](#ID_Study_area)\n",
    "-   [Survey ID](#ID_survey)\n",
    "-   [Sample Station ID](#ID_Sample_station_ID)\n",
    "-   [Camera Location ID](#ID_Camera_location)\n",
    "-   [Deployment ID](#ID_Deployment_ID)\n",
    "-   [Image ID](#ID_Image_ID)\n",
    "-   [Sequence ID](#ID_Sequence_ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to [Appendix A - Table A2](#metadata-standards-appendix-a-table-a-2) for examples of recommended naming conventions. If you wish to rename your images, it is highly recommended that renamed images reflect the associated [Image ID](#ID_Image_ID). IDs or file names should not have spaces or leading zeros. Alternative naming conventions may be used, but the goal should be to minimize duplication of IDs (and/or file names).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data entry software can be used for batch processing of image names, which can significantly reduce data processing time compared to renaming images manually (e.g., [Timelapse2](http://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/) [Greenberg, 2018], [Reconyx MapView](http://www.reconyx.com/software/mapview;) [Reconyx, Holmen, WI, USA]) or other tools (e.g., [WildCo Lab's Image Renamer](https://github.com/WildCoLab/WildCo_Image_Renamer) [WildCo Lab, 2021b]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is not always necessary to rename images. For example, renaming would not be required if data are stored in a folder structure that identifies the [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location) and the [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) from which it was collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "(#TOC-metadata-standards-file-structure)=\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.2 File structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Image data ideally should be stored in a hierarchical structure as shown in ([Figure 1](#metadata-standards-figure-1)). Each level would typically comprise a series of file subfolders containing data from the level below it (e.g., a [project](#Heirch_Project) folder with study area subfolders, with each [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area) with [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) subfolders etc.). For example, [Figure 2](#metadata-standards-figure-2) shows the file structure for a [project](#Heirch_Project) that consisted of two [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area)s, each with one [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) and each [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) with two [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location)s with one [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment) period and 2 [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence)s per [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is often not the way we store this information in the form of CSVs (e.g., if there are only one or two [study area](#Hierarch_Study_area)s, it might not make sense to store this information in a separate CSV file). These metadata standards suggest a CSV structure similar to that of other metadata/data repositories (e.g., [B.C. Metadata Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/wcmp_v1.pdf) [RISC, 2019], [Wildlife Insights Minimum Metadata Standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jg-WybmVeGlWGrbPpwuwJCgranOV1r3M_LrzELttfK0/edit#gid=412365965) (Ahumada et al., 2019), [WildTrax](https://portal.wildtrax.ca) that consists of four CSVs associated with these metadata standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Project CSV\n",
    "-   Sample Station/Camera Location CSV\n",
    "-   Deployment CSV\n",
    "-   Image/Sequence CSV (includes Event Type = \"Tag\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The information from each CSV can be linked using identifiers for each of the levels in the folder structure/ hierarchy (refer to [Figure 3](#metadata-standards-figure-3)) so that redundant information does not need to be repeated, and the chance of error is reduced. The connections between the levels and CSVs are also outlined in [Appendix A - Table A2](#metadata-standards-appendix-a-table-a-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Remote Camera Metadata Standards: Metadata Template (RCSC et al., 2023)](#metadata-template) for the template CSVs and additional information.\n",
