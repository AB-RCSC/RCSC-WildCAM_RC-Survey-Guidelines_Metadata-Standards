    "# 9.0 Image/Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "The **image/sequence level** provides information on the data for an image (individual photo) or sequence of related images (e.g., images that are grouped as part of the same trigger \"event\").\n",
    "\n",
    "An **image** may be part of a multi-image sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sequence** refers to a user-defined group of images or video clips that denote a single \"detection event\". Often camera users choose a certain time threshold (\"sequence definition\") to define independent detection events; (e.g., 30 minutes (O'Brien et al., 2003; Gerber et al., 2010; Kitamura et al., 2010; Samejima et al., 2012) or 1 hour (e.g., Tobler et al., 2008; Rovero and Marshall, 2009)). This threshold should be recorded in the Survey Design Description field, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a sequence [Event_Type](#event-type) is used, only enter data once for the sequence of images (not for each unique image) and use the first image of the sequence as the Sequence ID, as this is the time of the first detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Data Management section](#TOC-metadata-standards-data-management) for information on image processing software, and recommendations on data file structure and naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(#TOC-metadata-standards-image-id)=\n",
    "## 9.1 Image ID\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique alphanumeric file name for the image. It is highly recommended that users develop a photo naming convention prior to entering data. It is important to include (at a minimum) the camera location, date, time, and image number when generating an Image ID to avoid duplicate file names. For example, the Deployment ID and image number would not be unique for the same deployment within Reconynx overflow file subfolders (i.e., when the number of images exceeds 9,999, another folder is created [e.g., 101MEDIA] and the numbers in the image file names begin again at IMG_001).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using either of the following naming conventions for Image IDs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  \"Deployment ID\"_\"Camera_Serial Number\"_\"Image_Sequence_Date_Time\"_\"Image Number\" (e.g., \"BH1_17-JUL-2018_P900FF04152022_22-JUL-2018 10:34:22_IMG_100\"), or\n",
    "2.  \"Deployment ID\"_\"Image_Sequence_Date_Time\"_\"Image Number\" (e.g., \"BH1_17-JUL-2018_22-JUL-2018 10:34:22_IMG_100\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The file name used to create the Image ID should ideally match the file name of the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "(#TOC-metadata-standards-sequence-id)=\n",
    "## 9.2 Sequence ID\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique alphanumeric for a multi-image sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sequence ID should ideally consist of the Deployment ID and the names of the first and last images and videos in the sequence (separated by \"_\") (i.e., \"Deployment ID\"_\"IMG_#[name of first image in sequence]\"_\"IMG_[name of last image in sequence]\". For example, if a particular sequence contains five images, the Sequence ID might be \"BH1_22-JUL-2018 IMG_001-IMG_005\". If \"IMG_\" prefixes are used to create the Sequence ID, they ideally should match the names of the original photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter \"NULL\" if this field is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the first image of a sequence is the only image used to derive the Sequence ID, the remaining images typically also include useful information (e.g., images of all individuals in a group). Therefore, it is ideal to archive all of the images from a sequence. If it is not possible to submit all of the images, users should ideally submit the image(s) from a sequence that best represents the sequence (e.g., those that can be used to verify the Species and Individial Count).\n",

    "## 9.3 Image/Sequence Date Time (DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The date and time of an image, or the image chosen to represent the sequence. Depending on the [Event_Type](#event-type), Image/Sequence Date Time may be reported for an individual image, or the first or representative image (i.e., the image with the most information). For example, if three images were included in a sequence, but the Sex Class could only be discerned in the second image [all else remaining equal], the second image would be the best representative image of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Record the Image/Sequence Date Time as \"DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS\" (e.g., 22-JUL-2018 11:02:02).\n",
    "\n",

If there is more than one wildlife Species present in an image/sequence, data for each Species should be entered on a unique row but with the same Image ID or Sequence ID (reporting as [Event_Type](#event-type) = \"Tag\").\n",
    "\n",
    "For detections where you are unsure of the specific Species, report the level of lowest taxonomic ranking known (e.g., \"CLASS,\" \"ORDER,\" \"FAMILY,\" \"GENUS\"), followed by the scientific name of the taxa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a detection of an individual that is in the Canidae family, but for which the Genus or Species or unclear, report \"FAMILY CANIDAE.\" Refer to the Species_Crosswalk table for ease of reference.\n",
