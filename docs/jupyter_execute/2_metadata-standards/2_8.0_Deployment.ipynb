    "A [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment) is a unique placement of a camera in space and time. There may be multiple [deployments](#Heirch_Deployment) for one [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location). [Deployments](#Heirch_Deployment) are often considered as the time between [visits](#visit) to a [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location) (i.e., [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment) to service, service to service, and service to retrieval). Any change to [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location), sampling period, camera equipment (e.g., [Trigger Sensitivity setting](#Settings_Trigger_sensitivity), becomes non-functioning), and/or conditions (e.g., not [baited](#BaitLure_Bait) then not [baited](#BaitLure_Bait) later; camera SD card replaced) should be documented as a unique [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment).\n",

    "On rare occasions, a camera may be non-functioning in the middle of a [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment) period but functioning at the start and end of the [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment) period (e.g., snow covered for a few days).

    "To accurately measure [survey](#Hierarch_Survey) effort in the event of camera failure, we recommend that users set the camera's [Trigger Mode(s)](#Settings_Trigger_modes) field to \"[Time-lapse Image](#Timelapse_images)\" to capture at least one image at a consistent time each day. This will allow users to more accurately determine failure dates. For example, it may be difficult to determine a failure date for a camera that is only occasionally [triggered](#Trigger_event) by animals (e.g., on a weekly basis). Taking an image at a prescribed interval also provides a consistent record of site conditions over time (e.g., snow cover, vegetation growth).\n",
