    "The **image/**[**sequence**](#Heirarch_Sequence) **level** provides information on the data for an image (individual photo) or [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence) of related images (e.g., images that are grouped as part of the same trigger \"event\").\n",
    "\n",
    "An **image** may be part of a multi-image [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "A [**sequence**](#Heirarch_Sequence) refers to a user-defined group of images or video clips that denote a single \"detection event\". Often camera users choose a certain time threshold (\"[sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence) definition\") to define independent detection events; (e.g., 30 minutes (O'Brien et al., 2003; Gerber et al., 2010; Kitamura et al., 2010; Samejima et al., 2012) or 1 hour (e.g., Tobler et al., 2008; Rovero and Marshall, 2009)). This threshold should be recorded in the Survey Design Description field, if applicable.\n",

    "When a [Sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence) [Event Type](#event-type) is used, only enter data once for the [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence) of images (not for each unique image) and use the first image of the [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence) as the [Sequence ID](#ID_Sequence_ID), as this is the time of the first detection.\n",

    "## 9.1 Image ID\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique alphanumeric file name for the image. It is highly recommended that users develop a photo naming convention prior to entering data. It is important to include (at a minimum) the [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location), date, time, and image number when generating an [Image ID](#ID_Image_ID) to avoid duplicate file names. For example, the [Deployment ID](#ID_Deployment_ID) and image number would not be unique for the same [deployment](#Heirch_Deployment) within Reconynx overflow file subfolders (i.e., when the number of images exceeds 9,999, another folder is created [e.g., 101MEDIA] and the numbers in the image file names begin again at IMG_001).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using either of the following naming conventions for [Image IDs](#ID_Image_ID):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  \"[Deployment ID](#ID_Deployment_ID)\"*\"Camera_Serial Number\"*\"Image_Sequence_Date_Time\"_\"Image Number\" (e.g., \"BH1_17-JUL-2018_P900FF04152022_22-JUL-2018 10:34:22_IMG_100\"), or\n",

    "Even though the first image of a [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence) is the only image used to derive the [Sequence ID](#ID_Sequence_ID), the remaining images typically also include useful information (e.g., images of all individuals in a group). Therefore, it is ideal to archive all of the images from a [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence). If it is not possible to submit all of the images, users should ideally submit the image(s) from a [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence) that best represents the [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence) (e.g., those that can be used to verify the [Species](#species) and Individial Count).\n",

Depending on the [Event Type](#event-type), [Image/Sequence Date Time](#image-sequence-date-time) may be reported for an individual image, or the first or representative image (i.e., the image with the most information). For example, if three images were included in a [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence), but the [Sex Class](#Tags_Sex_class) could only be discerned in the second image [all else remaining equal], the second image would be the best representative image of the [sequence](#Heirarch_Sequence).\n",
