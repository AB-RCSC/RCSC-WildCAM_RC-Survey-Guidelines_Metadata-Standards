    "A **sample station** refers to a grouping of two or more non-independent [camera locations](#Heirch_Camera_location), such as when cameras are [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) or [paired](#Sampledesign_paired). For example, multiple cameras in close proximity to one another for individual animal identification or on/off-trail comparison could be considered a [sample station](#Heirch_Sample_station).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each [sample station](#Heirch_Sample_station) should have its own unique [Sample Station ID](#ID_Sample_station_ID) (grouping ID). Within a [sample station](#Heirch_Sample_station), each camera will have a unique [Camera Location ID](#ID_Camera_location) and location (unless multiple cameras are on the same [camera attachment](#camera-attachment) point; e.g., tree).\n",

    "This alphanumeric field applies if reporting [camera locations](#Heirch_Camera_location) in easting and northing UTM coordinates. The UTM zone refers to the coordinate system that divides geographic areas into north-south zones. In Alberta the UTM zones are either 11, 12, or TTM. Enter all other UTM zones in the [Camera Location Comments](#Comments_Camera_location_comments) field (e.g., zones 7-10 for British Columbia), or use [Latitude Camera Location](#Coord_Latitude_camera_location) and [Longitude Camera Location](#Coord_Longitude_camera_location) instead of UTM coordinates.\n",

    "The margin of error of the GPS unit used to record spatial information (e.g., \"5\" m), such as the coordinates of the [camera location](#Heirch_Camera_location). On most GPS units (e.g., Garmin) this information is provided on the unit's satellite information page. [GPS Unit Accuracy](#GPS_unit_accuracy) may vary with the make and model of the GPS unit, surrounding vegetation, infrastructure, atmospheric interference, etc.\n",
